# VueTalk
VueTalk - Vue Open Community Real-Time Chat Room App Using Vue.Js and firestore using its realtime changes capabalities.

VueTalk App using a cutting edge Real-Time capabilities provide by Firebase/Firestore with Vue Framework. I used event listner, which update data on fly via firestore database and show these changes in the App instantly without reloading anything.
I also use Props for data transfer among components, also use Moment.js to format date and also Vue scroll plugin for autoscrolling.
The App is then deploy on Firebase using firebase hosting and for the UI design i used Materilaize.CSS by google.
